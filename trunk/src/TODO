Image conversion to/from wxWidget

Provide more demos

Fix squares.py demo, something's wrong with the algorithm. It's running but too slow.

Add iterator for SparseMat

What about Seq template class?

- asMat() not working well if we want to convert a list of 32-bit floating points to Mat

- 2d lists should have better documentation: i.e. when is list of Mat, when is list of lists

- introduce debugging mode so that people know which argument has been converted, which has been not
