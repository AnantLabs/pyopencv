Image conversion to/from wxWidget

Provide more demos -- may ask people to help :)

Fix squares.py demo, something's wrong with the algorithm. It's running but too slow.

Add iterator for SparseMat

What about Seq template class?

- 2d lists should have better documentation: i.e. when is list of Mat, when is list of lists

- introduce debugging mode so that people know which argument has been converted, which has been not

- to_list_of_... returns vector_....
- added to_vector_... (idea is to make to_list_of_... obsolete in the future)
- propose to group a major change of representation from 1D array and 2D array back to std::vector
  arrays.
