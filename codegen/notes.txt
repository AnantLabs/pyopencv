Boost.Python is _not_ thread-safe. Therefore, be very careful when dealing with threading functions like cvSetMouseCallback, cvCreateTrackbar, etc. In the callback functions, do not invoke 'print' for example.

cvSaveImage() in Boost Python mode doesn't work with jpg file, works with png file. Does it has anything to do with python?

SWIG was used when building the ML component of the official Windows binary release of OpenCV 2.0. It was turned on when building the HighGUI component, how dummy!!

Perhaps, TDM-GCC builds differently from MinGW GCC when mangling the C++ declaration names. Seems like C++ functions are not properly detected from the official library using MinGW. I'll work with _just the C interface_ for now.
