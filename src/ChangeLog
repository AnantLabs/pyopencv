Change Log
==========

pyopencv-2.0.0.wr-1.0.0 beta release
------------------------------------

- The first release of PyOpenCV. Many fundamentals of OpenCv has been
ported to Python. However, there are still some functionality not yet
available. Lots of small issues need ironing out. Just tell me which
part you want PyOpenCV to improve and I will take time to improve it.
