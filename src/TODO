Image conversion to/from wxWidget

Provide more demos -- may ask people to help :)

Fix squares.py demo, something's wrong with the algorithm. It's running but too slow.

Add iterator for SparseMat

What about Seq template class?

- 2d lists should have better documentation: i.e. when is list of Mat, when is list of lists

- introduce debugging mode so that people know which argument has been converted, which has been not

- propose to group a major change of representation from 1D array and 2D array to ndarray
  of specific dtypes. In other words, each cv dense data type like Vec2f is a dtype itself.
  Use PyArray_RegisterDataType().
