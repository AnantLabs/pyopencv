#summary General instructions for installing PyOpenCV.

In short, there are four major steps:

    # Install Boost.Python (including Boost.Build and bjam) -- only Boost 1.41.0 and above works. There's a bug that has only been fixed in Boost 1.41.0.
    # Install PyOpenCV
    # Install NumPy <-- you can do it _after_ PyOpenCV is installed

These notes describe installing PyOpenCV from source on the following platforms:
