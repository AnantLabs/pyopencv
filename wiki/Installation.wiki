#summary General instructions for installing PyOpenCV.

=Prerequisites=

==Supporting platforms==

PyOpenCV is designed to be cross-platform. The official supporting platforms are Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. However, on Mac OS, I can mostly speculate since I barely have access to Mac OS at all. 

==Software requirements==

    # [http://www.python.org Python] version 2.5 or later. Python 3 is theoretically supported but not yet tested with.
    # [http://numpy.scipy.org NumPy] version 1.2.0 or later. However, you can install NumPy after PyOpenCV is installed. PyOpenCV requires and detects NumPy at run-time, not at install-time. There are many ways to install NumPy. For example, you could follow [http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/ SciPy's Installation page]. You do not need to install SciPy though. 

=Installation=

Like other packages, PyOpenCV can be installed from a binary distribution or from a source distribution.

==Install from a binary distribution==

This is the preferred way. Check the [http://code.google.com/p/pyopencv/downloads/list Downloads] page to see if there is a binary distribution of PyOpenCV suitable for your platform.

==Install from a source distribution==

Right now, only gcc 4.x compilers are supported. The reason is that I have not tried other C++ compilers. If you have successfully built PyOpenCV using another C++ compiler, your knowledge contribution is much appreciated.

In short, there are three major steps:

    # [Installation_OpenCV Install OpenCV 2.0]
    # [Installation_Boost_Python Install Boost and bjam]
    # [Installation_PyOpenCV Download, configure, build, and install PyOpenCV]
