#summary General instructions for installing PyOpenCV.

Like other packages, PyOpenCV can be installed from a binary distribution or a source distribution.

==Install from a binary distribution==

This is the preferred way. Check the [Downloads Downloads] page to see if there is a binary distribution of PyOpenCV suitable for your platform.

==Install from a source distribution==

Right now, only gcc 4.x compilers are supported. The reason for this limitation is that I have not tried other C++ compilers. If you have successfully built PyOpenCV with another C++ compiler, your knowledge contribution to this page is much appreciated.

In short, there are four major steps:

    # [Installation_OpenCV Install OpenCV 2.0]
    # [Installation_Boost_Python Install Boost.Python]
    # Install PyOpenCV
    # Install NumPy <-- you can do it _after_ PyOpenCV is installed

These notes describe installing PyOpenCV from source on the following platforms:

    * [Installation_Windows Windows]
    * [Installation_Linux Linux]
    * Mac OS X
