==Is PyOpenCV 64-bit compatible?==

No, not yet. But it is a feature I hope PyOpenCV will have one day. The main problem is that I do not have a 64-bit platform to test with.

==Declaration X or declaration X of class Y is not exposed. Can I have it exposed?==

If the declaration you are looking for belongs to the old C interface, check if there is an equivalent declaration in the new C++ interface. Otherwise, find the related issue in the "Issues" tab (or file one if there is none), and post your request. I will try to fix the issue when I have time. Certainly, the more requests there are, the higher priority the issue will receive.

==Is PyOpenCV compatible with Python 3?==

Boost.Python is now compatible with Python 3. When NumPy is eventually compatible with Python 3, I will refine PyOpenCV to make it compatible with Python 3.
