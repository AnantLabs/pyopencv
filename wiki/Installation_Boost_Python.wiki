#summary Instructions for installing Boost and bjam

=Installing Boost and bjam=

==Get Boost==

  # Go to http://www.boost.org.
  # Download [http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/ Boost source distribution] version [http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.41.0/ 1.41.0] or later. There is a bug in using Boost.Python under Python 2.6.3 and later that has only been fixed very recently in Boost 1.41.0 (thanks to Guy K. Kloss for having pointed it out).
  # Extract the source distribution to somewhere on your platform. We refer to the extracted folder as `<boost_dir>`. It is not necessary to install Boost.

Note that, right now you should rely on a Boost source distribution to install rather on any packages of Boost that have been pre-compiled for your platform. Unless you know how PyOpenCV is compiled and linked against Boost libraries, just don't push your luck. This technical issue is mainly due to that I don't have time to tweak the setup file to deal with those situations yet. But I am working towards that convenience.

==Get bjam==

  # PyOpenCV relies on Boost.Python to interface with OpenCV, and on Boost.Jam (or bjam) to compile its internal Python extension. The recommended way to get Boost.Jam is to [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941 download a prebuilt executable] from SourceForge. If a prebuilt executable is not provided for your platform or you are using Boost's sources in an unreleased state, it may be necessary to [http://www.boost.org/doc/tools/build/doc/html/jam/building.html build bjam from source] included in the Boost source tree.
  # To install Boost.Jam, copy the executable, called `bjam` or `bjam.exe` to a location accessible in your PATH. Go to the `<boost_dir>/tools/build/v2` directory and run `bjam --version`. You should see something like:
{{{
            Boost.Build V2 (Milestone N)
            Boost.Jam xx.xx.xx 
}}}
  # *On Ubuntu*: alternatively, run `sudo apt-get install bjam` to install bjam.
