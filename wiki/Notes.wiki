==Notes to remind me how I should develop PyOpenCv==

1) Should I convert every OpenCV's array into a numpy array? It's is a lot more efficient to deal with numpy array than with a collection of (mutually inconsistent) past and current OpenCV arrays.

The following arrays will be replaced by numpy array:
 * CvMat
 * IplImage
 * cv::Mat
 * std::vector < T >, where T is in (primitive data types or CvPoint-like types)
