==Function output argument==

In PyOpenCV, every output argument is treated as an inout argument. This is to preserve  the calling sequence of the function in C++. If you do not know what to specify for an output argument, just key in None. For example, to generate a pyramid of images from a source image 'mat', invoke:
{{{
    pyr = buildPyramid(mat, None)
}}}
