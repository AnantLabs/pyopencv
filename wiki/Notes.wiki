=Notes to remind me how I should develop PyOpenCv=

==Function output argument==

In PyOpenCV, sometimes an output argument is treated as an inout argument. This is to preserve the calling sequence of the function in C++. If you do not know what to specify for an output argument, just key in None. For example, to generate a pyramid of images from a source image 'mat', invoke:
{{{
    pyr = buildPyramid(mat, None)
}}}

==Crash issue with CV_SSE2==
During the compile time of OpenCV 2.0, if CV_SSE2 is enabled, assembly SSE2 code is used instead of C code. This works fine in C/C++ but *crashes* in Python. Therefore, disabling SSE2 when compiling OpenCV 2.0 is a must.
